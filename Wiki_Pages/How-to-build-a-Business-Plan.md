Importan concept:

**Gross Margin**

Gross margin is net sales less the cost of goods sold. The gross margin reveals the amount that an entity earns from the sale of its products and services, before the deduction of any selling and administrative expenses. For example, a company that sells electronic downloads through a website may have an extremely high gross margin, since it does not sell any physical goods to which a cost might be assigned. Conversely, the sale of a physical product, such as an automobile, will result in a much lower gross margin.

The amount of gross margin earned by a business dictates the level of funding left with which to pay for selling and administrative activities and financing costs, as well as to generate a profit. It is a key concern in the derivation of a budget, since it drives the amount of expenditures that can be made in these additional expense classifications.

The calculation is:
(Net sales - Cost of goods sold) / Net sales

**Operating Margin**

The operating margin reveals the percentage of profit generated by operating activities. This percentage is useful for determining the productivity of the basic underlying operations of a business, excluding all financing considerations. The measurement can also be used to determine that portion of sales dollars that remain after all operating expenses to pay for financing costs, such as the cost of interest on loans.

Operating activities are comprised of the following expenses:
* Cost of goods sold (Direct materials, direct labor, and factory overhead)
* Selling costs
* General and administrative costs
* One-time events, such as the proceeds from or payouts for lawsuits, are not included in operating activities for the purposes of this calculation.

The calculation is:
(Sales - Operating expenses)/Sales

The operating margin should be tracked on a trend line, to see if there is a long-term positive or negative trend in the ability of a business to continue earning a profit from its operating activities.

This is a particularly important measurement when a business is deriving a large part of its income from financing the sales of its products. In these situations, an analyst wants to know if the underlying operations of the business are still generating profits, or if the entity is relying upon its financing activities to stay afloat.

**Net Profit Margin**

Net profit margin is the percentage of revenue left after all expenses have been deducted from sales.  The measurement reveals the amount of profit that a business can extract from its total sales.

The calculation is:
(Net profits / Net sales) x 100 = Net profit margin
