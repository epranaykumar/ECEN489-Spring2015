Starting a Business steps - Lean Canvas
---

*“Ideas are a dime a dozen. People who implement them are priceless” - Mary Kay Ash*

This is taking into consideration that you already have an initial idea of what you are wanting to work on. This business approach uses the lean canvas model revolving around the idea of “fail fast, fail hard”. The lean canvas is an actual chart that can be printed out and have the sections filled it. It focuses on the most basic things that need to be understood before moving forward with a project. In addition, this wiki demonstrates how to use the lean canvas with other startup practices. In a startup, most cases involve having little capital or little time to react with it. With this concept, a startup can improve its chances of success by proving there is a need for it quickly, otherwise resources are being wasted.

**Why is lean canvas helpful?**
The Lean Canvas provides some protection of resources and time. A common investment practice is roughly $50,000 of 10%. This allows investors to get involved without heavy spending. This means a company has already been valued at $500,000. It’s challenging to get a larger investment in the beginning than that without a very promising MVP or signed customers proving sales or value already exceeds $500,000.

**1. The Lean Canvas**
Fill out a lean canvas business model [here](https://leanstack.com/LeanCanvas.pdf)
The actual lean canvas is on page 5. This pdf does a good job of breaking down the basics of the lean canvas for first time users. There are books written on the topic which go into much more detail. **This step should be done often!** Projects pivot often. Reevaluating your idea every once in a while makes sure you are on track. A personal strategy of mine is using sticky notes in the boxes.

**2. Market Validation**
Once your original concept is set, come up with a range of questions asking about the basic need of your product. You don’t necessarily need to expose your product at this point. Questions can be “Have you ever had troubles with ___?” or “Would you buy a product that solves ___?”. There is a big difference between people saying they would buy something and actually buying it, but this stage allows you to see if you are on the right path with the general concept. It can also give hints of how you may need to change your product. For example with our product, people may say they don’t want another social media network but do like exploring checking in places. In that case, that info can be used to pivot the project. Maybe the best approach is to build an app that checking in on it updates all social media attached to it.

The trick is to get a good number of results. With a set of questions, try to ask at least 50 people with a lot of them being strangers.

**3. Data Evaluation**
Use the results of 50 people to reevaluate your product and edit it as needed to meet the needs of the people, OR continue building it if its proved to be desirable without much need for pivoting. Generally, that’s very rare. Most ideas change at least slightly after the first evaluation.

**4. Repeat**
Repeat steps 1 through 3 until you are satisfied with a MVP for pitching to investors or showcasing to customers. The product does not need to be polished at this point.

**5. Get Money**
Depending on the approach taken, this is when advice gets cloudy. There are a lot of solutions each with their own pros and cons. Based on the choice taken, the next steps taken can be done in varying orders. The best solution is to find a mentor with business and startup experience to decide the best approach. Check out the “Investments” section below to see different types of ways to raise capital.

**6. Establish your business**
As stated in step 5, this step may get moved around. A business does not need to be legally established until right before it is intending on generating income. However, for certain investing strategies, it may be best to be established before going through that process. How the business is established also has pros and cons that investors will be looking at. Some prefer corporations and others LLC’s. Some won’t even look at you unless you are a sole proprietor. Look below at “Company Versions” for descriptions to determine best choice. As stated before, **find a mentor!**  It will make everything simpler. Find one person you can confide in and ask questions. I had attorneys come in and their greatest advice was “Just because you are a startup, don’t act like a startup”. A mentor can help you avoid critical mistakes.

**7. Legal**
Everyone has differing opinions here. I personally few NDA’s as a pointless necessity. I don’t care to sign them but do if asked. I have met investors who refuse to sign them. In most cases, people don’t care about the idea. It’s the work behind the idea that makes them valuable. I’m not saying don’t do NDAs. Some ideas are truly valuable in their own right. Having an MVP supporting the idea just makes it much more valuable. 

Also make sure to get as much in writing as possible. Need everyone to agree on something through email? Have them also respond with “I agree”. Simple steps like that prevents some legal issues in the future. Write down agreements. Write down sales. Keep all receipts. Document everything.

Investments
---
**Angel** - An angel investor is an affluent individual who provides capital for a business start-up, usually in exchange for convertible debt or ownership equity. A small but increasing number of angel investors organize themselves into angel groups or angel networks to share research and pool their investment capital, as well as to provide advice to their portfolio companies. For example, the [Aggie Angel Network](http://aggieangelnetwork.com/)

**Venture Capital** - Financial capital provided to early-stage, high-potential, growth startup companies. The venture capital fund earns money by owning equity in the companies it invests in, which usually have a novel technology or business model in high technology industries, such as biotechnology and IT. The typical venture capital investment occurs after the seed funding round as the first round of institutional capital to fund growth

**Accelerators/Incubators** - At this point, I'm putting these together because they are sometimes accidentally interchanged. However, incubators generally help more with starting stages when it's closer to an idea. Accelerators help with growth. An accelerator  is typically limited to a 3-4 month period, basically intended to jump start your business and then kick you out of the nest. Examples of incubators and accelerators: [Startup Aggieland (A&M)](http://startupaggieland.com/), [Seed Sumo (Bryan/College Station)](http://www.seedsumo.com/#home), [Capital Factory (Austin)](http://capitalfactory.com/), [Y Combinator (California)](https://www.ycombinator.com/)

**Bootstrapping** - The starting of a self-sustaining process that is supposed to proceed without external input. In terms of a startup, all money earned goes straight back into the business. This process is very difficult to pull off if the startup requires high capital to start.

**Crowdfunding (online)** - The practice of funding a project or venture by raising monetary contributions from a large number of people, typically via the internet.Best practice is to do it in early stages after an MVP has been created for demonstration.

**Crowdfunding (Texas)** - Due to new laws, Texas allows a new version of crowdfunding where people are classified as investors without the need of having the necessary investment licenses. This adds additional protection to the original process of asking for money from family. Texas is one of the first states to try this. More information will be added soon.

Company Versions
---
**LLC** - A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is formed by 1 or more individuals or entities through a special written agreement. The agreement details the organization of the LLC, including provisions for management, assignability of interests, and distribution of profits and losses. LLCs are permitted to engage in any lawful, for-profit business or activity other than banking or insurance. Filing with the Washington Secretary of State is required.

**Sole Proprietor** - An individual or married couple in business alone. Sole proprietorships are the most common form of business structure. This type of business is simple to form and operate, and may enjoy greater flexibility of management, fewer legal controls, and fewer taxes. However, the business owner is personally liable for all debts incurred by the business.

**Partnership** - 2 or more persons (usually not a married couple) who agree to contribute money, labor, or skill to a business. Each partner shares the profits, losses, and management of the business, and each partner is personally and equally liable for debts of the partnership. Formal terms of the partnership are usually contained in a written partnership agreement.

**Corporation** - A Corporation is a more complex business structure. A corporation has certain rights, privileges, and liabilities beyond those of an individual. Doing business as a corporation may yield tax or financial benefits, but these can be offset by other considerations, such as increased licensing fees or decreased personal control. Corporations may be formed for profit or nonprofit purposes. Filing with the Washington Secretary of State is required.

**Non Profit (501-c3)** - A nonprofit organization that is exempt from federal income tax if its activities have the following purposes: charitable, religious, educational, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, fostering amateur sports competition, or preventing cruelty to children or animals.


Glossary

**MVP** - Minimum Viable Product. It’s the product with the highest return on investment versus risk. It has only the core features needed to be deployed and is in no way polished. It may be a prototype, an entire product, or a sub-set of product (such as a feature). The minimum viable product is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort. It is not ready for mass production but more of a test for early adopters of a product. Examples of these are video game betas or developer kits for certain tech like the Oculus. 

**NDA** - Non-disclosure agreement. A legal contract between at least two parties that outlines confidential material, knowledge, or information that the parties wish to share with one another for certain purposes, but wish to restrict access to or by third parties

**Pivot** - To change the idea and pursue in a different direction. Changing focus. This can be as small as deciding app vs. website to as large as scrapping an entire plan and using what’s built to accomplish something else. For example, I saw a company working on hospital network architecture pivot and received a large investment to pursue server side applications.
